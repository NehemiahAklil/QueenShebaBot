# Canis Simensis

A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database optimized for handling werewolf gaming groups but also can handle other groups as well.

Originally a Pɧơɛnıх fork, was created for personal use of [this group](https://t.me/Ethiowerewolf).

<!-- Feel free to add it to your groups though! -->

Can be found on telegram as [𝐀𝐛𝐲𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐚𝐧 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫](https://t.me/AbyssinianModeratorBot).

If you want to create your own bot, you can basically follow the steps given [here](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars/tgbot/blob/master/README.md)
